The current status is the minivm can execute the MMU test (test_mmu.S).
It is a simple test with a user space that prints "Hello!" and tests
some privilege exceptions.  Run "make test" to see it in action.


You can attach the LLDB debugger at the beginning of user space as follows

$ make test QEMU_OPTS='-s -S'

And in another tab:

$ make dbg LLDB_OPTS="-o 'break set -a 0x20000000' -o c"
